"""Identity Pool Credentials.

This module provides credentials to access Google Cloud resources from on-prem
or non-Google Cloud platforms which support external credentials (e.g. OIDC ID
tokens) retrieved from local file locations or local servers. This includes
Microsoft Azure and OIDC identity providers (e.g. K8s workloads registered with
Hub with Hub workload identity enabled).

These credentials are recommended over the use of service account credentials
in on-prem/non-Google Cloud platforms as they do not involve the management of
long-live service account private keys.

Identity Pool Credentials are initialized using external_account
arguments which are typically loaded from an external credentials file or
an external credentials URL. Unlike other Credentials that can be initialized
with a list of explicit arguments, secrets or credentials, external account
clients use the environment and hints/guidelines provided by the
external_account JSON file to retrieve credentials and exchange them for Google
access tokens.
